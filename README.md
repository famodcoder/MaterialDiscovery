# ðŸ§ª Inorganic Semiconductor Bandgap Prediction

A machine learning project focused on predicting the bandgap energy of inorganic semiconductors using material descriptors. This project leverages regression models to accelerate materials discovery and support electronic device design.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Bandgap energy is a critical property that determines the electrical conductivity and optical behavior of semiconductors. Traditional methods for calculating bandgaps (e.g., DFT) are computationally expensive. This project uses ML models trained on curated datasets to predict bandgap values efficiently and accurately.
